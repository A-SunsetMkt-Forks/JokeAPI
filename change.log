> [2.0.0] - The complete rewrite
    - JokeAPI was completely rewritten and should now run like 100x better and be more easy to develop and maintain
    - TODO:
        - Add support for selecting multiple categories at once (for example: "https://sv443.net/jokeapi/category/Dark,Miscellaneous/")
        - "?type" URL parameter to specify the type of the served joke ("single" or "twopart")
        - "?contains" URL parameter to only serve jokes that match the provided search query
        - "?containsFuzzy" URL parameter to only get the joke with the highest match score on a fuzzy search
        - Improve the "Try it out" section in the docs
        - Gzip encoding
        - Prevent submission of empty jokes
    - DONE:
        - Updated some dependencies
        - Updated contributor guide
        - Reformatted the jokes to always contain all flags
        - Reformatted the jokes to have the IDs beforehand, furthermore increasing performance and making it easier to know which joke ID belongs to which joke
        - Added multiple scripts that should be run before contributing to the project
            - "npm run reformat" to reformat jokes from the old pre-2.0.0 syntax to the new 2.0.0 syntax
            - "npm run reassign-ids" to make sure all jokes have the correct IDs
