## Is your project explicit or unsafe for minors to view?
<!-- Please remove the option that doesn't match your project -->
- **Yes**, it contains explicit material
- **No**, it doesn't contain explicit material

<!-- Note that this doesn't refer to JokeAPI's usage in your project. If you don't filter out unsafe jokes but your project is otherwise safe, you can still choose "yes" here -->
