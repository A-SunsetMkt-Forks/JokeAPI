## Jokes folder
This directory contains all joke-related files and folders:  
  
- [`./regular/jokes-xy.json`](./regular/)
    > This folder contains all regular jokes files. These are available on the GitHub repository as usual.
- [`./dark/dark_jokes-xy.json`](./dark/)
    > This folder is created on startup and it contains all dark, racist and sexist jokes. It's excluded in the GitHub repository.  
    > As I still want JokeAPI to be 100% open source, if you want access to the dark jokes, see [my short term solution.](#finding-dark-jokes)
- [`./template.json`](./template.json)
    > This file used as a template whenever a joke of a new language is added and a new jokes file needs to be created.  
    > The name of the new jokes file is in the format `jokes-xy.json` or `dark_jokes-xy.json`, where xy is the language code.

## Finding dark jokes
<sup>(v2.3.3+)</sup>  
Currently dark jokes are no longer available on the GitHub repository due to a TOS violation.  
If you need access to them, you can contact me via E-Mail or Discord (contact info on [my homepage](https://sv443.net/)).
